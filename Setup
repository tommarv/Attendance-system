 Setup 
  
A>  What you will need - setup

1.  Arduino (Uno, nano,...)
2.  RFID RC522 module
3.  Wires
4.  Raspberry PI (PI2, PI3, or other linux OS small pc)
5.  RFID card 13.56MHz
6.  PC or notebook for programming Arduino with Arduino IDE software, putty software - ssh client
7.  one free socket on router or switch will need raspberry


B>  Schematics


1.  Open schema between Arduino and RF522 module: arduino-rc522-1024x421.jpg or 
    Ardino-RFID-RC522-1024x319.png and connecting to USB port on Raspberry PI


2.  Open
C>  Programs:

1.  Install in your PC Arduino IDE software, flashing arduino with source code : Arduino_program_RFID_send_serial.ino

2.  If you  monitor serial port 

2.  You will need the RFID library and the programs which you can download from the file that i attached . 
    If you don't know how to add a library , here's the link https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries
